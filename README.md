I'm currently working as a support specialist. This job inspired me to lear more about software testing and development, and here I am - inspired, highly motivated and ready to share with you my journey in the sphere of software testing. Already familiar with the basic knowledge of SDLC, testing documentation, SQL and main tools (Postman, Charles, DBeaver and Android Studio).I have a strong desire to learn and be familiar with all new cutting edge technologies.

Skills: SQL / Postman / Android Studio / DevTools / TestRail / JIRA / Charles / DBeaver
